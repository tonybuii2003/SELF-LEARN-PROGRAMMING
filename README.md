# My Experience with the Relational Database Course

I'm excited to share my journey through the Relational Database Course, where I explored developer tools like VS Code, PostgreSQL, and the Linux/Unix command line. The course's hands-on approach helped me gain practical experience and knowledge.

## What I Learned

- **Bash Commands**: The course started with basic Bash commands, teaching me how to navigate the file system, script in Bash, and use the terminal more effectively.

- **PostgreSQL and SQL**: I learned to create and use a relational database using PostgreSQL and SQL. These skills are crucial for managing databases efficiently.

- **Git**: The course wrapped up with Git, a version control system. Now, I can track my work, collaborate with others, and revert changes when needed.
